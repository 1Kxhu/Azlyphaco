You're in a repository that forked a web-based code editor, Monaco, from the Microsoft Corporation.

`rosploco.html` is the file which contains most modifications, as described in the repository description. It has the autocomplete code and the documentation. For unintellectuals using YouTube to learn to make Roblox exploits, this file what you replace `monaco.html` with.

To use this in your project, you must credit me and Microsoft. We provide an easy way to do this. Just insert this code at the top of the rendered document:

```lua
-- Monaco and Functions by Microsoft and EthanMcBloxxer on GitHub under the MIT License.
```
